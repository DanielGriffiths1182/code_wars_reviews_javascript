CodeWars Review

Archive of completed CodeWars exercises, language - JavaScript

Short description and number in chronological order.

1 Utilize Math.PI and conditional - alternate solutions, just fooling around

2 Calculate the decibel of a sound wave, given its intensity as a parameter for the dBScale/db_scale function

3 Given an object (array) of integers, return the binary equivalent of the sum of the elements

4 Fix the below javascript code without removing any lines of code. The intended output is Hello World.

5 Work with OOP, javascript - introduction to constructor concept, differs from ruby - experimenting

6 Fix this helloWorld function

7 Return string with no whitespace, form object (string)

8 Write function avg which calculates average of numbers in given list.



9 Write a method sum (sum_array in python) that takes an array of numbers and
  returns the sum of the numbers. These may be integers or decimals for Ruby and any
  instance of Num for Haskell. The numbers can also be negative. If the array does not
  contain any numbers then you should return 0.



10 In javascript, Array is one of basic data types. Define an empty array can use var arr=new Array() or var arr=[]

  Array has an attribute: length, if there is an array named arr, using arr.length to know how many elements are contained in the array.

  Each element in the array has an index, use arr[index] to get the value of element.

  index always start from 0, so the first element of array is arr[0], the last element of array is arr[arr.length-1].

  If we want to add new elements to the array, you can use the array method: push(). It can add an element to the end of the array. Instead, if we want to remove the last element of the array, you can use the array method: pop(). for example:
