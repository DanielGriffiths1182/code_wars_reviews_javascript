#JavaScript/Python CodeWars Review

**(JavaScript first, Python below-second-)**

**Archive of completed CodeWars exercises, languages - JavaScript, Python**

*Short description and number in chronological order.*

#JAVASCRIPT

- 1 Utilize Math.PI and conditional - alternate solutions, just fooling around

- 2 Calculate the decibel of a sound wave, given its intensity as a parameter for the dBScale/db_scale function

- 3 Given an object (array) of integers, return the binary equivalent of the sum of the elements

- 4 Fix the below javascript code without removing any lines of code. The intended output is Hello World.

- 5 Work with OOP, javascript - introduction to constructor concept, differs from ruby - experimenting

- 6 Fix this helloWorld function

- 7 Return string with no whitespace, form object (string)

- 8 Write function avg which calculates average of numbers in given list.



- 9 Write a method sum (sum_array in python) that takes an array of numbers and
  returns the sum of the numbers. These may be integers or decimals for Ruby and any
  instance of Num for Haskell. The numbers can also be negative. If the array does not
  contain any numbers then you should return 0.



- 10 In javascript, Array is one of basic data types. Define an empty array can use var arr=new Array() or var arr=[]

  Array has an attribute: length, if there is an array named arr, using arr.length to know how many elements are contained in the array.

  Each element in the array has an index, use arr[index] to get the value of element.

  index always start from 0, so the first element of array is arr[0], the last element of array is arr[arr.length-1].

  If we want to add new elements to the array, you can use the array method: push(). It can add an element to the end of the array. Instead, if we want to remove the last element of the array, you can use the array method: pop(). for example:



- 11 I've create three function, and defined some global variables, please select some variables that can make up the name of the function, and return them(Please note the uppercase and lowercase letters are different).

 After mission 1 finished. you should click "Submit" to see my three questions, and write the answer in function answer1,  answer2,answer3



- 12 Find the last element of a list.



- 13 As you probably know, Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:
 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... Write a method that takes the index as an argument and returns last
 fibonacci number.



- 14 (could not solve with JavaScript - this is someone elses solution)!!! --- Kept getting infinite, (index) to high

 As you probably know, Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:
 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... Write a method that takes the index as an argument and returns last
 digit of (index) fibonacci number.



- 15 At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family member’s age and the youngest  family member’s age and calculate the difference between them.

 You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed ‘age’ of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].



- 16 Concatenate strings.



- 17 Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd"
 for odd numbers.



- 18 Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.



- 19 Remove a exclamation mark from the end of string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data
 is always a string, no need to verify it.



- 20 You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string.
 If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:



- 21 Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.



- 22 We need a function that can transform a number/boolean into a string.
 What ways of achieving this do you know?



- 23 Your task is to make two functions, max and min (maximum and minimum in PHP) that take a(n) array/vector of integers list as input and outputs, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that array/vector.



- 24 The function findDigit takes two numbers as input, num and nth. It outputs the nth digit of num (counting from right to left).

  Note

  If num is negative, ignore its sign and treat it as a positive value.
  If nth is not positive, return -1.
  Keep in mind that 42 = 00042. This means that findDigit(42, 5) would return 0.













#PYTHON

- 1 Remove all whitespace from object (string)

- 2 Multiply two integers and return the product

- 3 Return (Even) or (Odd) depending on the integer value of (number)
